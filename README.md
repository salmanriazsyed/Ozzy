# Horror Game - Unity Project

A chilling first-person horror game created as part of a **Multi-Platform Game Development course** in my *Master's program in Artificial Intelligence at Queen Mary University.* Developed in Unity, the game offers a suspenseful journey through eerie environments, engaging storytelling, and interactive gameplay that immerses players in a dark narrative.

### Game Overview

This project, developed in one month, includes:
- **Two Playable Levels**: A terrifying journey across different locales that challenge the player’s courage.
- **Storyline Integration**: A storyline that unfolds through real-time events and protagonist dialogues, displayed at checkpoints for a seamless storytelling experience.
- **Starting Cutscene**: A cinematic introduction that draws players into the atmosphere of the game world.
- **Immersive Environments**: Players are set in a detailed hilly environment followed by a dark house with various mazes, which add to the suspense and build a terrifying atmosphere.

### Gameplay Mechanics

Players will:
- Experience a **first-person perspective** that heightens immersion and tension.
- Progress through levels and checkpoints that unveil the protagonist’s thoughts, creating a deeper connection with the storyline.
- Interact with a variety of objects and areas, each adding to the horror experience.
